# Balance Routing (Raw vs Snapped)

Passivbot carries two balance values with distinct responsibilities:

- `balance`: hysteresis-snapped balance for sizing/order-shaping stability.
- `balance_raw`: true/raw wallet balance for risk/accounting accuracy.

## API Contract

### Rust orchestrator input (`OrchestratorInput`)

- `balance` is required and used for sizing logic.
- `balance_raw` is used for peak/PnL-sensitive risk gates.
- If `balance_raw` is missing/non-finite, risk-gate paths fall back to `balance`.
- If `balance_raw` is explicitly `<= 0`, risk-gate paths treat it as non-actionable and early-return.

### Python runtime (`src/passivbot.py`)

- `self.balance` stores the snapped value.
- `self.balance_raw` stores the true/raw value.
- Helper methods:
  - `get_hysteresis_snapped_balance()` -> snapped `balance`
  - `get_raw_balance()` -> raw `balance_raw` (fallback-compatible for older test stubs)

## Routing Rules

- Use snapped balance for sizing-like paths:
  - min-effective-cost eligibility
  - order-shaping paths that are intentionally hysteresis-stabilized
- Use raw balance for risk/accounting paths:
  - peak reconstruction (`balance_peak`)
  - realized-loss gate floor checks
  - auto-unstuck allowance budget calculations
  - TWEL enforcer auto-reduce (wallet exposure uses raw for conservative risk)
  - TWEL entry gating (prevents new entries that would exceed TWEL at real balance)
  - unstuck action selection (wallet exposure threshold uses raw)
  - equity/accounting displays

## Migration Guidance

For any external caller or test fixture constructing orchestrator JSON:

1. Provide both `balance` and `balance_raw`.
2. Do not treat `balance` and `balance_raw` as interchangeable:
   - replacing `balance_raw` with snapped `balance` can reintroduce peak drift bugs.

For lightweight Python test doubles:

- Prefer defining both `balance` and `balance_raw`.
- If a legacy stub only has `balance`, `get_raw_balance()` fallback keeps tests functional, but this should be transitional.

## Regression Coverage

See:

- `tests/test_passivbot_balance_split.py`
- `tests/test_orchestrator_json_api.py`

These tests verify split routing and the peak-drift regression scenario.
